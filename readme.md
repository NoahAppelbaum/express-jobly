# About

This is the backend for Jobly, a RESTful careers webservice. This codebase was developed exclusively through TDD, using Express/Node. A frontend site for this webservice, built in React, can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/NoahAppelbaum/jobly-frontend), and a live deployed demo can be found [here](https://na-jobly.surge.sh/). (If you're looking at the demo, please pardon the delay when you first attempt to log in! It is hosted on a free service that takes a moment to "spin up".)
